# Autochthys
Automaton -- meaning machine

Ichthys -- meaning fish

Assume control of the Autochthys, a wretched "vita artificialis" constructed of pure sin...

Will you struggle against your new reality? Or perish like a dog (fish)?

*Autochthys* is a fish-themed bullet-hell rouge-like. More hyphenated-adjectives on their way. It was made from scratch (not really) and in one week (not really).

The current build is version ALPHA, and may or may not be eventually finished. While it may be a proof-of-concept in it's current form, we (the programmer) retains some pride in its polish.

Autochthys was created on top of Raylib, and programmed in Odin.
